This website was created by Lia Arroyo as part of her Level 2 Computer Science project in 2019.

This website is made for the admins of the (fictional) Ormiston Athletic Club to enrol club members, 
view/modify/display their details, fees, and scores. 

For more info on the project and the features of the website, please check the Planning, Testing and Evidence slides in the documentation folder.
